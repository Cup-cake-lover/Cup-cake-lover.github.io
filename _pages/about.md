# About Me

Hi! I'm Hari Prasad SV. (For my full name, check out my CV page! :P)

I am currently a master's student in Physics at the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School for Physics and Astronomy, affiliated with the University of Cologne. My primary interests include nonequilibrium statistical physics, computational neuroscience, complex systems, and machine learning.

Feel free to browse through some of my projects (though the page is still updating!). If you have any suggestions or comments, drop me an email at [hpvariyar@gmail.com](mailto:hpvariyar@gmail.com). I'd love to hear from you!
